            <strong>Please be aware that changing the file location from the default folder may
                significantly slow down your download speed.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>This is due to the limitations of the new Android Storage Access Framework (SAF), which
            can be considerably slower when accessing non-default locations.
        </p>

            <i>For the best performance, we strongly recommend keeping the default folder for your
                downloads.
